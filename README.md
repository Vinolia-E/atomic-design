# Atomic Design Project

This explores how UI libraries are structured and built using the **Atomic Design** methodology.

---

## **Project Overview**

The **Atomic Design Project** focuses on understanding and applying the concept of breaking down user interfaces into fundamental building blocks: **atoms, molecules, organisms, templates**, and **pages**. Each phase of the project emphasizes practical exercises to create reusable and scalable design systems.

### **Objectives**
1. Learn and apply Atomic Design principles.
2. Capture and categorize UI elements from real-world examples.
3. Create visually appealing and organized design systems for different use cases.
